git:- it is a version control system
it is basically used to save the history of the files

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.

git --version --> check the version //if you are getting any error check 
it and correct it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

let's start learning git with vscode!

1)git init -- used in initalizing an existing directory as git repository
2)Seeting your info.
  i)git config --global user.name "setting your name"
  ii)git config --global user.email "setting your email"
3) git config --global --edit :- used to edit your details which
you can further save by typing :wq.
4)git status --tells the status of repo
5)git add first.html
6) staging area
we add files in staging area and then we commit it
7) git commit -m "initial commit" --to commit your files.
** if you ignore -m then it will redirect you to vim.
8) git log -- to check previous history of and commit of logs.
9) how to visit your commits?
** checkout -> git checkout hashcode
10) branch -> to distribute features to contributers 
**you can create multiple branches
git branch navbar --> creation of navbar branch 
git checkout navbar --> going to navbar branch
***a way to write this all in a line
git checkout -b aradhana/about
-----------------------------------
after this you can add files in this branch
and commit it further
----------------------------------
after that switch to the navbar branch or the branch you previously
created 
**observe that the files you created in aradhana/about will not be there
**how can we merge the files in aradhana/about branch to navbar branch?
--by using git merge aradhana/about 
----------------------------------
.gitignore --> it is a place where you can place all you confidential 
files so that the end user could not read it.

--> simply add the files you want to ignore in .gitignore 
directly to vs code.
---------------------------------
